<h2 class="cover">How Computers Work</h2>
<p>A book by <a href="https://www.davekilian.com/">Dave Kilian</a></p>
</div>

> Welcome to *Primer*! Like the title says, this is a book about the way computers work.
>
> It's surprisingly difficult to get straight information about what goes on inside your computer! The information is out there, but not organized in any way that makes it easy to understand. Fixing that is my goal with this book! Even though we're going to cover some technical concepts, this book will be an easy read &mdash;Â no coding experience or power user skillz needed!

> I hope you enjoy reading this book!<br>&ndash;Dave
